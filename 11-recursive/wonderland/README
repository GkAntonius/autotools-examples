The wonderland library.
-----------------------

Generate the configure script with
    autoreconf -vif

Run the configure script either from this directory or from a subdirectory
to generate the Makefile
    mkdir build
    cd build
    ../configure

Finally build the library, and possibly install it
    make
    make install
